# GymCustomerInteraction
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do you know if a customer is no longer with you? You can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.
For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they're unlikely to come back.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Our task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.
